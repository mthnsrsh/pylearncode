#early days with python
in order to create a systematic coding style, I decided to create a disciplined routine where i record each days work here like a blog just to see my progress and improve accordingly.

possibly in the near future i will be doing projects and with experience and support maybe in the near future with the help of my coding knowledge i have acquired over time i will be able to solve Humanities greatest problems .

I have no idea whats it gonna be  , lets play it cool
